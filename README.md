# RäkBot aka ShrimpBot 🦐🤖
## How to install
Setup a bot integration for Slack [here](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot), you do need to have elevated access to your Slack team in order to do it.
Grab the *API TOKEN* and set it as `BOT_TOKEN` in your deploy.
Deploy however you wish, I like [now](https://zeit.co/download).
And lastly grab a beverage 🍺 and have a nice chat with Räkan 🦐
## How to use
Write 'Räkan' in any channel the RäkBot is a member of to get a reply with your username. Much personalized 🙌
